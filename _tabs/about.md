An archive of space dust for delving into quantum computing, generative AI, and the chemistry of named reactions.

## About me

I am originally from [Gwangju, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju). I majored in Chemistry, Nanoscience and Computer Engineering and worked as a [software developer](/assets/Portfolio.pdf) in Seoul for three years. 

My current research interests lie in advancing predictive simulations of molecules and materials by (i) improving scalable electronic-structure methods (HCI, DFT), (ii) developing hybrid quantum–classical surrogate models for chemistry as the most decent applications of quantum computing, and (iii) building reliable excited-state dynamics workflows with quantified uncertainty. Broadly, I am always keen on AI/ML tools including LLMs to accelerate modeling and enhance decision-making within the scientific computing.

## Miscellaneous
Beyond my research, I enjoy exploring the fields of aerospace, robotics, and laser spectroscopy.\\
In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Making** — end-to-end projects 
(e.g., furniture, food, and automation tools for my real purposes — grading, translation, cleaning, ....)
- **Exploring** — new AI tools 
(e.g., Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Runway ML, Suno, Udio, Notion AI...) and everyday robots
- Reading — literatures from China and Japan (e.g., 三體, 聊齋志異, 紅樓夢, 羅生門).
