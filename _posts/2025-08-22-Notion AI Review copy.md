## Abstract:
My Impressions of Using Notion AI
After spending some time with Notion AI, I’ve noticed a mix of strengths and weaknesses. Overall, it’s a handy tool that can speed up everyday work, but it’s not without its limitations.

## 👍 The Pros
- Writing Automation
Notion AI is excellent for quickly drafting content like meeting notes, blog posts, or summaries. It saves a significant amount of time, especially for non-native English speakers who find its grammar and style suggestions very helpful.
- Summarization and Organization
The summarization features are one of its biggest strengths. Long notes or meeting records can be condensed into concise overviews, and it can even generate task lists or highlight key action items automatically.
- Seamless Integration with Notion
Since it’s built directly into the Notion ecosystem, there’s no need for complicated setup. It integrates naturally with databases, documents, and pages, making it feel like a native part of your workflow.
- Idea Brainstorming
When you’re stuck, Notion AI works well as a brainstorming partner. Whether it’s generating project ideas, suggesting titles, or drafting marketing copy, it’s great at providing a starting point to build from.
## 👎 The Cons
- Lack of Depth
Notion AI tends to provide surface-level answers. In more technical or specialized fields, the output often lacks accuracy or detail. Compared to GPT-based tools, it can feel less comprehensive.
- Limited Customization
It’s not always easy to control the exact tone or style of the output. For specific formats like LaTeX or heavily commented code, the tool feels restrictive.
- Value for Money
Most of the useful features are locked behind a paid plan. If your main needs are simple summarization or proofreading, the cost can feel hard to justify—especially if you’re already using other AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude.
- Context Limitations
Notion AI doesn’t fully understand your entire workspace. It usually works on the page you’re currently in, which means it struggles to connect ideas or content spread across multiple documents.
## 💡 Final Thoughts
If your goal is fast drafting and summarization inside Notion, this tool shines. But if you’re looking for in-depth research, technical writing, or fine-grained control, you may find it lacking. For many, it works best as a convenient assistant that lives where your notes already are, rather than a replacement for more powerful standalone AI tools.
