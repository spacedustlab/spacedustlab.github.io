## Do We Still Need PhDs?
I began my career as a developer in what seemed like a very promising time, just a year before the rise of LLMs. Exactly one year later, I witnessed skilled developers— from entry-level to even senior experts—being rapidly displaced. At first, it was just simple tasks—code autocompletion or grammar checks. But over time, AI began to creep into areas once thought safe: complex architecture design, performance optimization, and even tasks reserved for highly experienced senior developers.
I had assumed, “Maybe entry-level jobs, maybe mid-level roles—but surely decades of expertise can’t be replaced.” And yet, I found myself facing the reality that even what once seemed untouchable could now be automated. That was the moment I began to ask the same question about the PhD itself: What is its purpose, and why should this institution continue to exist?
Human knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate. Massive language models can scan through tens of millions of papers in seconds, seemingly outpacing even the most seasoned librarian. They can code, summarize papers, and even propose experimental designs. So, do we really still need PhDs?

## 📖 The Questioner
AI excels at producing answers. But it still falters when it comes to asking questions.
At its core, the PhD is a training ground for asking questions:
```
Why is this phenomenon important?
What variables are we missing?
Where should this line of research go next?
```
So then, how does one ask a good question? For me, that can be possible by knowing the answer. Perhaps it is less a matter of innate talent than of training. As teenager, we could move freely between abstraction and concreteness: turning the abstract into the tangible, and vice versa. Sometimes mathematics felt concrete, while science became abstract, and at other times the reverse was true. In the end, good questions don’t arise because we already know the answer—they come because we can at least anticipate the shape of a possible answer. Which means that, even now, the endless expansion of knowledge remains indispensable.

## 🌱 The One Who Endures Uncertainty
I can’t claim to excel at this part myself. I don’t consider myself particularly good at enduring uncertainty. The only advantage I have is that I don’t bear the heavy responsibility of abandoning research midway to support a family—a burden many others face.
But in my own family, I’ve seen someone demonstrate this quality in a remarkable way. With a full-time job unrelated to science, he has nevertheless spent over a decade studying physics on his own, purely out of childhood fascination. There are no rewards, no professional recognition, no signs of genius-like brilliance—only steady persistence in learning under uncertainty. Watching this has made me rethink what true talent looks like. To endure uncertainty while still finding meaning in it—perhaps that is the very essence of what a PhD requires.

## 🌍 The Connector
Today’s problems are complex. Climate change, space exploration, drug discovery, quantum computing—none can be solved within the confines of a single discipline.
The PhD, then, is not only about becoming an expert in one field but also about becoming a translator across domains:
Turning the language of chemistry into physics,
Physics into computer science,
And weaving all of it back into society and human life.
This role as a “translator of knowledge” is not something that mere information retrieval can replace. It is an intellectual bridge—and while AI can rearrange information, only humans can walk across that bridge, assign meaning, and bring people together.

## Conclusion: The Meaning of the PhD
The question is whether we let the dog bite or tame it. If we tame the technologies that threaten jobs, people can still find ways to endure.
