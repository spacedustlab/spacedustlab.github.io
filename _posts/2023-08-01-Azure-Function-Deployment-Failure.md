Two precious hours of my life disappeared thanks to this cryptic error message that appeared just when I was happily trying to deploy my `Azure Function` to Azure, after it had already been working perfectly in my environment using the latest `Isolated` model in `dotnet 7` (note: this had nothing to do with the error), along with the excellent application configuration management service `Azure App Configuration` and even `KeyVault`! (You can check out more details on how to achieve this in [this post](https://blog.warnov.com/posts/AAC-KV-FX/) I wrote about it).

As you can see, the error message doesn’t provide much information. Except that you can go look at a log file. Which, when opened, majestically shows us:

The same: nothing. Not a clue about what’s happening.

I restarted Visual Studio, restarted the machine, tried from another PC, then from an Azure VM, and always had the same error, even though I had successfully deployed this function before. The fact that the `Azure Function` ran flawlessly on any machine I tried only confused me further.

It was only when divine providence, purely by chance, made `Visual Studio` show me the `Solution Explorer` in folder view `(Folder View)` that I noticed something very odd:

This made me realize that the project had somehow been duplicated (maybe due to an accidental `drag-and-drop`). And although the inner project was the one that had the latest version and worked correctly locally, when trying to deploy, the `Visual Studio` wizard gets confused because it finds that the project it is trying to deploy is contained within another project. However, the fact that the `Azure Function` compiled and ran fine made it very difficult to think of this, which I only noticed by chance.

When I noticed this, I hadn’t yet tried to solve the issue by deploying via FTP, for example. Although in this case I don’t think that would have been a problem, because in manual deployment I would only have uploaded the contents of the `bin` folder, which is what is required to run the function in Azure. Also, by looking at the folder structure in the FTP client, I likely would have noticed this irregularity.

So, I proceeded to delete the external files, then moved the internal ones up one level, and finally deleted the now-empty folder, leaving me with a structure like this:

After this, the deployment worked perfectly!

### Moral:

If your application works correctly and you’re sure everything has been configured properly for deployment, yet you continue to face deployment problems, it’s very likely that you have an incorrect file structure, like in the case shown here, that needs to be corrected.
